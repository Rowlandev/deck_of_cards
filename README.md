This project featuers a simulation of a playing deck of cards. The user will be able to move the cards freely as if they were actual playing cards. The user will also be able to reset the deck to pre-defined layouts in order to play some of the most popular card games.

Access to the current progression of the application can be seen in the website link.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- We are planning on building a web application to simulate a deck of cards. This application will allow users to have a deck of cards for any purpose that they have in mind. The application will allow users to play specific card games or play their own games. This web application will allow users to use our deck of cards in both a sandbox mode, where the user can control the cards however the user seems fit, as well as choosing a pre-existing gamemode where we have hardcoded the logic of a traditional card game ourselves. This will operate as a standalone web application, although it could have the potential to become a multiplayer game in the future. We think that this project will be very beneficial for us to learn and be useful for us and for others to use on the internet. We plan on using the most up to date technologies involving web applications. From our current assumptions, we will most likely use something along the lines of JavaScript, possibly React due to its high level of reusability and the focus React has on the idea of components. We also plan on using GitHub to allow us to collaborate efficiently and to practice a professional tool that we will most likely use in the future when we become professional software engineers ourselves. This project is also a beneficial choice for us because we realize that in terms of user stories, the amount of user stories is not predefined and we can continue to create them based on the needs required by the class. -->
